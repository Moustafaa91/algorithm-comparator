# üöÄ Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive single-page web application built with **React** that allows users to visualize, compare, and analyze the performance of popular algorithms. Whether you are exploring sorting/ searching or graph algorithms, this application offers an intuitive and engaging experience.

## Features

### **Sorting Algorithm Comparison**
- Compare popular sorting algorithms side by side.
- Analyze execution times across varying input sizes.
- Visualize the sorting process with detailed animations.

### **Sorting Algorithm Visualization**
- Select specific algorithms to visualize (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).
- Customize array size and animation speed for a tailored experience.
- Automatically generates random input arrays for sorting.

### **Searching Algorithm Visualization**
- Select algorithms like Linear Search or Binary Search for visualization.
- Customize array size, target value, and animation speed.
- Observe how algorithms perform step-by-step to locate target values.

### **Graph Algorithm Visualization**
- Visualize graph algorithms, including:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- Use predefined graph structures for simplified exploration.
- Real-time highlighting of visited nodes and edges during traversal.

## How to Add an Algorithm

Expand the application by adding new algorithms with the following steps:

1. Add the algorithm file to the appropriate folder under **`algorithm/`**.
2. Import the algorithm in **`algorithms/index.js`**.
3. Integrate the new algorithm into one of the selectors:
   - **`SortingAlgorithmsSelector.js`**
   - **`SearchingAlgorithmsSelector.js`**
   - **`GraphAlgorithmsSelector.js`**

Ensure input parameters and return structures align with the existing algorithms for seamless integration.

## How to Add a Custom Graph

Customize graphs for visualization using **`utils/graphGenerator.js`**:

1. Define node levels using the `level` constant to specify positions (top to bottom).
2. Use the `connections` constant to establish edges. Format:
   ```javascript
   source: [connectedNode1, connectedNode2, ...]
   ```

Follow the existing structure for consistent graph generation and visualization.
